Core User Expectations for the Search/Discovery Page
1. Provider-Based Browsing

Users want to filter or browse by streaming service (e.g., Peacock, Netflix, Tubi).

Ideally, users should be able to set their subscribed services in profile settings so search results and browsing automatically prioritize those.

2. Genre and Category Filtering

Ability to filter by genre (e.g., comedy, thriller), format (movie vs. series), or content type (documentaries, anime, reality TV).

Users expect stackable filters (e.g., "comedies on Peacock released after 2020").

3. Trending + Popular Lists (Contextual)

Global “trending” is fine, but users also want:

Trending on My Services (e.g., popular now on Hulu, Netflix, etc.)

New This Week or “Leaving Soon” (if tied to streaming availability)

Most-Watched by Friends / Community

4. Availability-Based Filters

Users want to:

See where a show/movie is streaming

Filter out titles that aren’t available on their platforms

Filter by free vs. subscription vs. purchase

5. Advanced Filtering Options

Release year range

Runtime (e.g., under 90 min)

IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes rating thresholds

6. Smart Search & Suggestions
