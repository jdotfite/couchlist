User Frustrations with Popular Movie & TV Tracking Apps (TV Time, Trakt, JustWatch, Letterboxd, etc.)
Tracking the movies and TV shows you watch should be convenient and fun – but according to many users, today’s popular tracking apps often fall short. This deep dive examines common complaints voiced by U.S. users about TV Time, Trakt, JustWatch, Letterboxd, and similar competitors. We’ll highlight recurring pain points (with real user examples) and categorize them into themes like UI/UX problems, syncing/data issues, feature gaps, community frustrations, and monetization woes. We’ll also identify competitive weaknesses and opportunities for a new app to differentiate itself while focusing on the core value: helping people track their watched content without hassle.
UI/UX Frustrations and Design Changes
A smooth and intuitive interface is critical for tracking apps, yet users often gripe about UI/UX missteps:
Cluttered or Confusing Interfaces: Several apps have been accused of becoming too busy or less user-friendly over time. For instance, JustWatch received backlash after an update replaced its simple, tabular list of streaming options with a “clunky, confusing” layout seemingly biased toward Apple’s ecosystem
. One movie buff vented that the change “destroyed the only thing [JustWatch was] good for,” wishing for an alternative service
. Similarly, Trakt’s newly redesigned mobile app (launched after “Trakt Lite” beta) is seen as less intuitive than the old version. A long-time Trakt VIP said the new UI “feels less intuitive” and “is still currently missing things I use all the time,” such as easy navigation to the next episode and certain sorting options
. In their words: “It is a very good looking UI, but most of the functionality that I utilize is missing.”
 This exemplifies form overtaking function – a visually modern design that sacrifices beloved features.
Too Many Steps for Basic Actions: A frequent complaint is when simple tasks require extra taps or scrolling. TV Time is often praised for its straightforward design (e.g. swipe to mark an episode watched) and clear “Up Next” list. Competing apps sometimes lack these conveniences. “Some have really pretty interfaces with lots of info but [lack] a simple way to swipe to mark [episodes] off,” one user noted
. They found many alternatives cumbersome: “Many require so many steps just to say you watched an episode.”
 Users clearly value quick, direct interactions – and notice when an app buries core functionality in menus.
Interface Changes Received Poorly: The maxim “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” comes up in user feedback. Letterboxd’s Android app underwent major changes in late 2025, which hardcore users vehemently disliked. According to one reviewer, “the changes to the UI make little sense and have ended up worsening the user experience, making the overall appearance far clunkier. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it – and the original app was far from broke.”
 Features were moved or removed in ways that frustrated loyal users. For example, Letterboxd’s app no longer showed a movie’s top reviews by default (instead prioritizing an endless cast list), and even basic navigation like swiping the screen edge to go back was disabled. “Why on earth would you take that away…?” one user asked, noting the app became “buggy as hell” in the process
.
Platform Inconsistencies: Users also point out when an app’s experience differs across platforms. Letterboxd again is a case in point – its iOS app has generally been polished, but the Android app was historically lagging. One Redditor (also a paying Patron) called the Android app “garbage in terms of UI/UX” and “an insult for their paying Android users,” especially when comparing it to the smoother iOS version
. This disparity in quality left Android users feeling second-class. Consistency is key: a tracking app needs to deliver a comparable, high-quality interface on all devices to avoid alienating part of its audience.
In summary, UI/UX complaints range from unwelcome redesigns to navigation inefficiencies. Users want clean, intuitive layouts that make tracking effortless – and they react loudly when updates seem to prioritize aesthetics or new features at the expense of practicality. The best interfaces are those that stay out of the way and let people quickly log and find information (episodes, reviews, etc.) without confusion.
Performance and Stability Issues
Even the richest feature set means little if the app doesn’t run smoothly. Unfortunately, many users report that reliability is a major pain point:
Crashes, Freezes and Slowdowns: TV Time in particular garners reports of lag and instability. “The app has become slow and buggy,” one longtime user lamented
. Another frustrated user on Android described how the app “just won’t load” at times – it freezes up, forcing them to uninstall and reinstall repeatedly just to use it
. That fix only lasts a few days before TV Time locks up again. “It’s a great app… when it works!” they added, highlighting how unreliable performance undercuts an otherwise beloved tool
. Such sentiments (“great when it actually works”) are echoed by many, indicating stability has become TV Time’s Achilles’ heel.
Sync and Update Failures: Users also encounter issues where actions don’t register or data doesn’t update in a timely fashion. For example, TV Time sometimes fails to mark episodes as watched or to remove them from the queue. “Sometimes, when I mark an episode as watched, it doesn’t disappear,” one user noted, describing a bug that undermines the whole point of a tracking app
. Others mention that TV Time will erroneously show incorrect episode counts (e.g. saying two episodes aired when only one did)
. These glitches force users to double-check or refresh repeatedly. Trakt’s new app has had hiccups too: a user in September 2025 reported it was “buggy as hell”, giving “unexpected response” errors whenever they tried to open a movie from their diary
. And over on Letterboxd, a formerly smooth app became “pretty much unusable” for some Android users – crashing during basic actions like writing a review or searching for a film, and throwing numerous error messages within a single week of use
. It’s clear that frequent bugs or technical issues drive users away in frustration.
Notification Problems: Part of “stability” for these apps is reliably notifying users about new episodes or messages. Here, TV Time again drew complaints: “After a while [my] TV Time notifications stopped working,” one user wrote, noting they no longer received alerts when new episodes aired
. Multiple people confirmed this issue, saying notifications had been broken for months on end
. For an app that advertises episode alerts as a feature, that’s a serious failing – and indeed some users left for Trakt or other solutions specifically because they “loved TV Time” but couldn’t tolerate missing notifications
. Trakt’s app has its own notification gaps (e.g. no push notification for friend activity or comments, since the community aspect is minimal), but the outright failure of promised alerts in TV Time was a top frustration.
General Reliability Concerns: Put simply, many users feel these apps can’t be counted on day-to-day. One person remarked in late 2025, “I’ve used this app since it was launched; the quality during the last year has really been going down.”
 That sentiment – that an app is deteriorating or being neglected – is fatal to user confidence. In the case of TV Time, some even wondered if the app was “dead” or abandoned by its developers due to the mounting bugs and lack of prompt fixes
. When basic interactions like marking a show or loading one’s list don’t work half the time, users naturally start searching for alternatives. As one new Trakt user put it: they switched because they were “so very tired of TV Time only working like half the time.”
 Reliability was more valuable to them than any specific feature TV Time offered.
In short, performance and stability issues – crashes, freezes, unresponsive features, broken notifications – are a major source of pain. Many users are not experiencing these apps as fire-and-forget utilities; instead, they’re spending time troubleshooting, reinstalling, and contacting support. An app that can deliver consistency and stability would directly address one of the loudest complaints in this space (“mess with it less, watch more” would be a welcome motto).
Data Accuracy and Syncing Woes
Under the hood, tracking apps rely on vast databases of shows and movies. When those data aren’t handled well, users notice. Common grievances include incorrect episode information, missing titles, poor syncing between services, and difficulty migrating one’s watch history. Key examples:
Episode Order & “Specials” Handling: A very specific but passionate complaint comes from fans of shows with non-standard episode structures (like holiday specials or OVAs). Trakt and any app that relies on its data (which comes from TheMovieDB) have a known issue: all special episodes get lumped into a separate “Specials” season, breaking chronological order. For series like Doctor Who or Futurama, which have critical story episodes that are technically “specials,” this is a dealbreaker. One power-user ranted that Trakt is “the absolute worst” for managing chronology of such shows – “literally impossible” to track them in order
. He noted Trakt’s team knows about the problem but “refuse to fix it,” instead telling users to create custom lists as a workaround
. His stance: “Any app that uses Trakt is an instant uninstall for me.”
 This highlights a data integrity gap: serious TV enthusiasts want a tracker that preserves the true watch order, including specials. By contrast, TV Time (which uses TVDB data) often does integrate specials into the normal episode list correctly
. That’s one reason some hardcore fans grudgingly stick with TV Time despite its other flaws – it “just gets” the episode ordering right for their favorite shows
. As another user summarized after testing dozens of apps: “Trakt…apps [are] riddled with [the] series chronology problem” and therefore unusable for certain shows
. This is a niche issue, but it’s repeatedly brought up on forums – a new app that nails episode ordering (perhaps by offering the option to merge specials into main seasons) could win the loyalty of this vocal group.
Missing or Stale Data: Users also complain when a tracker’s database doesn’t have a show or movie they’re looking for, or adds it too slowly. Trakt’s reliance on TMDB means it occasionally lacks niche or very new content. As one reviewer noted, “the app works off of TMDB which is less accurate than IMDb for niche shows/movies.” They gave an example that they sometimes have to wait a while before a new season or obscure movie is added to Trakt’s catalog, leaving them unable to mark it as watched
. JustWatch too has gaps – a Reddit user pointed out that at one point it wasn’t showing Tubi (a free streaming service) as an option, whereas previously it had
. Whether that was a temporary bug or a deliberate omission, it signaled to users that JustWatch’s once-comprehensive coverage could be faltering. TV Time, despite owning TVDB, has had issues with data syncing as well. Users mention instances where they correct info on TVDB’s site, but “the TV Time database does not sync correctly” to reflect the fix
. In those cases, one must contact TV Time support to update a series manually – and “most of the time they don’t even respond,” according to a frustrated user
. All these scenarios boil down to trust: users want to trust that the app’s data is complete and up-to-date without them having to beg for fixes.
Cross-Platform Sync (or Lack Thereof): Many movie/TV buffs use multiple services and integrations (for example, a media center like Plex scrobbling watches to Trakt, or logging films on Letterboxd but shows on another app). Sync issues in this context are another pain point. One Trakt beta user listed as a complaint that the new app “doesn’t show a live in-progress scrobble anymore for Plex or Jellyfin.”
 For those who enjoyed seeing what their media center was currently playing via Trakt’s interface, the feature’s removal was disappointing. Additionally, siloed ecosystems make life harder: Letterboxd and Trakt don’t sync with each other (though some third-party tools exist), and TV Time is a closed system altogether. There is a noticeable desire for consolidation or easy data transfer between services – which leads to the next point.
Import/Export and Data Portability: A huge friction point expressed by long-term users is the difficulty of migrating their watch history from one app to another. Many feel “locked in” to a platform where they’ve logged years’ worth of shows, because exporting that data (or importing it elsewhere) is cumbersome if it’s possible at all. “I would consider using another app if there was an import feature,” admitted one TV Time veteran, “At this point I’ve been using TV Time for so long that I’m invested.”
 This user and others describe the exhausting manual work required to move hundreds of entries. TV Time does allow users to request an export of their data, but the process seems unreliable – one person requested their data export multiple times, only receiving it after “the third time” and a long wait
. They suspected TV Time’s team might be dragging their feet “hoping we forget about it.”
 Even when you get your data, importing it into a new service (like Trakt or Simkl) might require third-party scripts or tools that average users won’t bother with. This is why we see posts like “I have so many movies and series watched that I just give up after a few days [of trying to switch] and go back to TV Time.”
 People feel trapped by the lack of easy data transfer. Some alternative services have recognized this demand – e.g. Simkl touts a 2-second import from TV Time, Trakt, IMDb, etc.
 – but the mainstream apps have yet to make migration truly seamless.
In summary, data-related issues cause frustration on multiple fronts: (1) How well the app’s database covers and orders content (especially tricky TV metadata), (2) How well it keeps that data in sync and up-to-date, and (3) Whether it lets users take their data elsewhere. Users want accuracy (no missing episodes, correct info), consistency (one source of truth across platforms), and control of their data. Apps that fail in these areas either force users into awkward workarounds or simply drive them away to competitors that promise better data handling.
Missing Features and Functional Gaps
Beyond bugs and data issues, users also identify feature gaps – capabilities or content they wish these apps had (or had not removed). Repeated gripes include limited tracking features, poor discovery tools, and other missing “nice to haves”:
No Support for TV (in Letterboxd): Perhaps the biggest content gap mentioned is Letterboxd’s lack of television tracking. Letterboxd is loved among cinephiles for logging films, but it pointedly does not support TV episodes or series (with a few rare exceptions for miniseries). Users frequently mention this as a “huge minus” that “makes the app feel incomplete.”
 Many don’t want to maintain a separate IMDb or TV Time account just for shows. On Reddit, multiple people expressed hope that “if Letterboxd got series,” they’d ditch other apps entirely
. In fact, in 2024 the Letterboxd team did hint that TV support is on the horizon, but as of now it’s not implemented
. This gap (movies vs. TV) is a fundamental one – it essentially splits users’ logging between platforms and is seen as a big opportunity for improvement. A single app that can elegantly handle both movies and TV would solve this complaint for many users.
Limited Episode Tracking Features in Some Apps: On the flip side, some movie-oriented or general trackers don’t have features that dedicated TV trackers do. For example, JustWatch allows creating a watchlist and marking items as seen, but it doesn’t support per-episode tracking or “progress” within a series in a meaningful way
. A user who tried JustWatch for tracking noted it “does not have a 'watched up to here' option, can’t log rewatches, can’t mark episodes as skipped, has very little episode detail…”
. Essentially, JustWatch is great for finding content to watch, but not for granularly tracking how far you are in a show or your episode-by-episode reactions. Similarly, some Trakt-based apps were criticized for lacking options like marking a show as “dropped” or tracking re-watches properly
. One user comparing many services praised TV Time for including features like “watched up to here” (marking progress if you’ve seen episodes out of order) and a “stopped watching” (dropped) status
 – features that others like Serializd initially didn’t have or emphasize
. If an app doesn’t allow these common user actions, it feels incomplete to serious trackers.
Customization and Personal Notes: A much-requested feature is the ability to add private notes or tags to entries. Users want to record why they added something to their list (e.g. “recommended by so-and-so” or “won award X”) or where/when they watched it. TV Time currently does not offer personal note-taking, which one detailed post flagged as a major shortcoming: “No personal notes option (impossible to remind yourself why you added a title).”
 Trakt actually does allow notes on list items – but only for VIP subscribers – and in the new mobile app those private notes were initially missing altogether (to be added later)
. For now, users have noticed their notes are inaccessible, which is frustrating. The desire for custom notes goes hand-in-hand with more sorting and filtering options. For example, being able to sort one’s watchlist by personal rating, or filter by a tag (“comedies”, “recommendations from John”, etc.). Letterboxd offers tags and some filtering on web, but users say its tagging system needs an overhaul
 and that finding or managing lists in the app can be difficult (one person wished “finding new lists was easier in the app” instead of seeing only the same popular lists
). Overall, trackers could do better at letting users organize and annotate their content beyond simple “watched” checkmarks.
Discovery & Recommendations (or Lack Thereof): Users often care not just about tracking what they’ve seen, but discovering what to watch next. TV Time earned praise in this area – its personalized recommendations based on viewing history are described as “always spot on” by some fans
. By contrast, a competitor like Serializd (a newer TV tracking social app) was called out for having no recommendations at all
. “It also doesn’t have any recommendations, and that’s a shame,” one user wrote, saying they missed TV Time’s suggestion engine
. JustWatch and Reelgood focus on discovery (showing what’s trending or newly added on services), but they don’t personalize it deeply to your watched list unless you pay for certain features. If a tracking app lacks robust discovery tools – like recommendation feeds, similar show suggestions, or trend highlights – users might find it “feature poor” compared to others. Conversely, if it leans too much into discovery at the expense of tracking, that can annoy users who just want to log and go (this balance is tricky).
Notifications and Calendar Features: A few feature suggestions point to gaps in notification and calendar functions. One Google Play review of TV Time requested a feature to notify the user about upcoming releases for items on their watchlist
. In other words, if you add an upcoming movie or a TV series that hasn’t premiered yet, the app could remind you when it becomes available. This is a sensible extension of tracking into planning, but not all apps offer it. (TV Time does notify you of new episodes for followed shows – when it’s working – but it doesn’t proactively remind you of, say, a series premiere you marked interest in, nor does Letterboxd/Trakt in their current forms.) The same reviewer also wished for a way to jump to a specific month in their calendar/watchlist, instead of endless scrolling
 – a QoL feature for those who have large watchlists scheduled out. These may seem like small misses, but for heavy users they represent daily friction that adds up.
Streaming Availability Info In-App: Another gap some users noted is the integration of “where to watch” information directly into the tracking app. TV Time, Trakt, and Letterboxd have all dabbled in this but not to the extent of dedicated services like JustWatch. For instance, TV Time does list some streaming options for shows, but one user complained it excludes certain library services (Hoopla, Kanopy) and doesn’t indicate which options are free, subscription, or require purchase
. “Watch options have no information about free vs subscription vs buying or prices,” they wrote, and noted that some options (like Microsoft Store or Fandango) always show up but can’t be filtered out
. This made TV Time’s built-in guide “less than helpful for finding streaming sources.”
 The absence of a robust streaming search within these apps is a gap often filled by using JustWatch/Reelgood separately. As one person mused about the “perfect app”: “TV Time, exactly as it is… PLUS JustWatch’s streaming options UI…” would be ideal
. The fact that users are wishing for mash-ups of features from different apps shows that each app alone has gaps that another covers.
Other Miscellany: A few more minor feature complaints include the inability to rate or review individual episodes on some platforms (Letterboxd doesn’t do TV at all; Trakt allows episode comments/ratings, TV Time allows episode ratings/reactions). Some Trakt users were annoyed that the new app removed links to external sites like IMDb or TVDB for more info on an episode
, which they used to rely on. Others miss seeing certain stats – e.g. Trakt’s app redesign hid total watch time and some profile statistics
, which VIP users enjoyed. And in TV Time’s case, some “original” features were removed and later restored after outcry: one user remembered a period about five years ago when TV Time’s big UI revamp temporarily removed the indicator showing how many episodes you have left (+X) and which episode number you’re on for each show
. The community demanded it back, as it’s a highly useful at-a-glance feature, and TV Time did re-introduce it. This anecdote shows that even seemingly small features (like an episode countdown) are dearly missed if taken away – emphasizing how carefully a tracking app must expand without regressing on the basics.
Overall, feature gaps and omissions become glaring once users have experienced a competitor that offers that functionality. No app in this space is feature-complete in the eyes of the community. Whether it’s content coverage (TV vs movies), tracking granularity, organizational tools, or discovery aids, each platform leaves some users wanting more. These gaps represent both frustrations for users and potential opportunities for any app that can fill them.
Community and Social Friction
One interesting aspect of movie/TV tracking apps is the social component. Some, like Letterboxd, thrive as social networks for media lovers; others, like Trakt, are more utilitarian with light social features tacked on. Users have raised various issues about community features – from toxic comments to lack of interaction – and clearly differ in how much “social” they want with their tracking:
TV Time’s Half-Baked Community: TV Time tries to foster a community with episode discussion threads, polls (favorite characters, how an episode made you feel), and even “groups.” However, users find the social tools a bit lacking. “TV Time…barely has community even though it tries to promote ‘groups’,” one user observed
. There is no way to directly message other users, and the app does not send notifications for new followers or replies – so interactions feel limited
. Users described the experience as “lonely” despite the large number of users on the platform
. Essentially, you can comment on episodes and get replies, but the app doesn’t do much to build connections – you might never know if someone followed you or responded, without manually checking. This limits the sense of community. Some also note the discussion quality on TV Time can be mixed; while many enjoy reading comments from other fans, others have encountered trolls or spoilers (TV Time attempts to keep comments spoiler-free for those not caught up, which is a plus). One user did mention seeing “some hateful comments” on TV Time, though they called it rare
. The lack of moderation tools like a robust blocking system is another issue – indeed someone reported that TV Time’s “blocking feature doesn’t work” properly (you still get notifications from people you blocked)
. All this indicates that TV Time’s social features, while present, have friction and shortcomings that leave users underwhelmed.
Trakt’s Sparse Social Scene: Trakt is almost the opposite of TV Time – historically it’s been more of a backend service, with less emphasis on in-app social interaction. There is a feed where you can see friends’ watching activity and you can write comments or reviews on shows/episodes, but the engagement level is low. One user stated plainly that the community in Trakt “is not much into comments.” They use Trakt for tracking, but “when I want to comment on something or see other people's comments I always check TV Time because the community in Trakt is [quiet].”
 This suggests Trakt feels empty on the social side – likely because it doesn’t have the volume of openly social users, and many people use Trakt passively (or via other apps) just to sync data. In fact, some threads on r/trakt are full of users swapping Trakt for Letterboxd or TV Time specifically to get more social features or better discussion. Trakt’s design also doesn’t push social interaction; for example, it doesn’t highlight popular reviews prominently the way Letterboxd does, and its forums are external (on a separate community site). The general sentiment is that Trakt is great for tracking, not for talking. This is a weakness for those who do want a social element – they might use Trakt in combination with something else to fulfill that need.
Letterboxd’s Vibrant (But Occasionally Frustrating) Community: Letterboxd is widely praised for its active social community around films. Users love reading each other’s reviews, liking and commenting, and the playful social dynamics (inside jokes, meme reviews, etc.). However, not everything is perfect. Some users complain about the content of the community – e.g., too many silly one-liner reviews cluttering the feed. “Having to scroll through dozens of reviews to see actual reviews that say anything, not just ‘this happened to my buddy Eric’ or ‘these characters are so gay’,” one user listed as a downside
. In other words, Letterboxd’s open community means quality control is up to the user – you have to curate who you follow or endure a lot of jokey content in the popular review section. Additionally, there are a few functional complaints: the “News from friends” feed on Letterboxd only shows the last 12 items, meaning if you follow active people, you might miss a lot of their activity unless you check each friend’s page
. And the Friends Activity page can get dominated by a few power users, making it less useful if your network isn’t balanced
. These are fairly specific issues, but they highlight that even in the gold-standard social tracking app, users have wishes for improvement (like better filtering of friend activity, or separate feeds for reviews vs. logs). It’s worth noting that Letterboxd lacks any direct messaging or group feature – all interaction is public comments or likes. This keeps the focus on content (films and reviews) rather than personal chat, which many like, but it means if someone wanted to, say, have a private discussion or form a small book-club-like circle, Letterboxd alone doesn’t provide that. In the context of our analysis, Letterboxd’s main “gap” is not community size or engagement (it’s strong there), but rather the scope (no TV, as mentioned) and some social UX quirks.
Niche App Communities (Serializd, etc.): Some newer entrants try to combine tracking with a social feed. Serializd (often described as “Letterboxd for TV”) has a feed where you see reviews and reactions from the community. Users have noted pros and cons: it has a modern interface and a growing user base, but “there are not many reviews or nuanced discussion” yet due to the smaller community
. It also “seems to be populated by younger people,” which one user said is fine but sometimes means the shows aren’t discussed “seriously” or with depth
. The same user did appreciate Serializd’s interface and features, but ultimately found TV Time’s larger community provided more “nuance” (more varied opinions) – albeit with the downside of some toxic comments slipping through
. Another user who started using Serializd mentioned it felt “lonely” unless you happen to be watching whatever is currently popular
. This underscores a challenge for any new app: until you reach critical mass of users, the “community” features can feel empty or “quiet” to the point of loneliness. People join these platforms partly to see others’ reactions – if the content they care about isn’t generating discussion due to a small user pool, the community feature isn’t delivering value.
Social vs. Solo Experience – Different User Preferences: It’s important to highlight that not all users want a social experience from their tracking app. Some explicitly do not want a feed or community posts cluttering the app. As one user said, “I know many love the social aspect and so some [apps] have leaned into that heavily. But that’s meaningless to me… taking up most of the front page with social stuff is just an annoyance.”
 They praised TV Time for at least making the social elements optional (you can dip into comments if you want, but your main dashboard is your watch list/upcoming, not a social feed). This is a key design balance: users who prefer a pure utility app find the heavy social focus of some competitors to be noise. On the other hand, users who crave community find the more utilitarian apps to be bland or “dead.” So far, no app has perfectly reconciled these two user types. The closest might be Letterboxd, which by virtue of focusing on film buffs has a self-selected community that most of its users actually want to engage with. But even on Letterboxd, you can use it in a “solo” way (just log and ignore the social feed) – though the app’s design certainly nudges you toward participating.
In summary, community features generate both loyalty and complaints. Common asks include: better moderation tools (to block or filter content you don’t want to see), notifications for social interactions (something as simple as knowing you got a follower or a reply, which some apps oddly lack), and an ability to tailor the social experience (e.g. filter out joke reviews, or highlight content from friends over strangers). There’s also a divide between users about how prominent the social aspect should be. Any new entrant will need to tread carefully in this area – ideally allowing those who want a social network to have one, while letting those who don’t to simply use the app as a private tracker. Striking that balance could itself be a selling point given how polarizing current offerings are on this front.
Monetization and Pricing Woes
How these apps make money (or attempt to) is a sore subject in many user discussions. Passionate users often don’t mind paying something to support a good app – but they have strong opinions on what’s fair and what’s not. Key complaints here involve subscription price hikes, feature paywalls, and intrusive advertising:
Trakt VIP Pricing Backlash: The most dramatic example is Trakt’s recent pricing changes. In 2025, Trakt announced that all legacy VIP subscriptions (many long-time users were paying $15 or $30 per year from older plans) would be moved to a new standard price (~$60/year) upon renewal
. This effectively doubled (or even quadrupled) the cost for loyal users. The reaction was outrage. “Old users feel a little blindsided,” one Redditor explained
. Another wrote: “I was VIP for years and thought I was grandfathered in. Nope. They just double your subscription fee… I really felt blindsided.”
 What made it worse was some users found out via a PayPal auto-charge or email, rather than clear early communication
. Many considered this a betrayal of trust, since Trakt had previously promised grandfathered pricing. “We were told we were grandfathered. They really screwed us,” said a 10-year subscriber who had been paying $15 and will now be expected to pay $60
. While Trakt’s team gave reasons (rising costs, need to fund development)
, the damage was done in perception. Users compared the new price to the cost of actual content services: “The price…for a TV tracking app is more than I paid for a year of Crunchyroll and Paramount+, apps that deliver actual content,” one user noted incredulously
. The consensus among many: $5/month (or $60/year) is too expensive for a tracking utility, no matter the features. This led some to actively seek alternatives, or at least drop VIP and continue with Trakt’s free tier. As one long-time supporter said, “I was just supporting them because it is a cool service. But not $60-annually cool.”
.
Free Tier Limitations: Hand-in-hand with the above, Trakt also introduced new limitations on free accounts around the same time – notably capping the number of personal lists (to 10 lists, 100 items each) for free users
. This was seen as a double whammy: features that used to be open (unlimited lists) were now VIP-only, pushing more pressure to pay, right as the price increased. Users who never paid now had part of their workflow restricted. “The main thing that gets me is the list limitations,” one user wrote. “Adding new interesting [things] to watch is now a pain… man it hurts.”
. This kind of “enshittification” (as some call it
) – where a once-open platform slowly gatekeeps features behind a paywall – tends to generate a lot of resentment. It wasn’t just Trakt: JustWatch also introduced a Pro subscription with some extra features (like more refined filters, perhaps notifications for new episodes, etc.), sparking a smaller version of this discussion in r/JustWatch. Some veteran users see any move towards monetization of formerly free features as a betrayal, even if it might be necessary for the app’s survival. The key is that users value honesty and proportionality – dramatic changes (like Trakt’s) are met with “either mismanaged or greedy” accusations
. A lesson here is that any monetization changes need to be handled with extreme transparency and ideally grandfathering to avoid alienating the core user base.
Advertising and User Experience: On the flip side of subscriptions, advertising is the common revenue model for free users. But if done poorly, it drives users away just as fast. A glaring example was seen with Letterboxd’s Android app in late 2025 – users reported a wave of aggressive, glitchy ads. “Ads are auto-opening without clicking… I keep getting pulled onto websites, which makes the app feel like malware,” one review said bluntly
. They described ads causing the app to load improperly and basically ruining the experience, pleading for Letterboxd to fix this “dark time.”
 Another user, who initially gave Letterboxd 5 stars, downgraded their review after the UI changes and bugs, noting the app had become “buggy as hell” and implying the issues came alongside whatever monetization or redesign shift happened
. Intrusive ads – ones that hijack the interface, pop up frequently, or redirect to browser – can be fatal to an app’s reputation. Users will either pay to remove them (if they love the app enough) or uninstall in disgust. We also saw complaints about other apps: the Moviebase app (a Trakt client) was said to present “frequent, incredibly intrusive ads” unless you buy the premium version
. CineTrak/Cinexplore was more lenient (one-time purchase to remove ads, and it’s inexpensive)
, but the presence of ads at all in a tracking context can annoy users given they often open these apps many times a day. Interestingly, TV Time has no ads – something users do appreciate. “I wonder how the app makes money since there’s no ads?” one user mused, acknowledging that TV Time’s free experience is refreshingly ad-free
. (The answer: TV Time’s parent company likely monetizes by selling aggregate viewership data and trends to studios/networks via their analytics business, so they don’t need in-app ads. But to the user, it feels like a completely free app.)
“Value for Money” Concerns: Many premium features offered by these apps are nice-to-haves, not essentials, which influences how users perceive their value. For example, Trakt VIP includes things like year-in-review stats, advanced filtering, VIP profile badge, etc.
 – features one Redditor dismissed as “who even needs this stuff?” and “things that make zero sense, that are just invented to have a bullet point”
. That user (and others) felt Trakt should focus on core features people actually want, rather than padding VIP with gimmicks like badges or even personal stats, if those additions then serve as justification for a high price
. Similarly, Letterboxd’s paid tier offers yearly stats, the option to filter by streaming services, and profile personalization. Some find that worth $19/year, others don’t. The takeaway is that users scrutinize the feature-to-price ratio closely. If they perceive that a service is charging “Netflix money” for far less value, they will complain. On the other hand, they will pay for tangible benefits: e.g., some Trakt users only went VIP to support server costs and to get features like no ads and unlimited lists – when those were reasonably priced, it was seen as supporting a beloved service. The recent changes shook that goodwill.
Overall, monetization frustrations boil down to users feeling either priced out or annoyed by ads. Frequent themes include: “I would pay, but the price is too high for what it is”
, “They suddenly started charging for X that used to be free”, and “These ads are making the app unusable”. There’s also a sense of competition: because there are multiple apps in this space, if one goes rogue on monetization, users threaten to migrate to another (or at least voice that threat on Reddit). That keeps some pressure on these services not to stray too far from the expectations of their user community.
Having detailed the common pain points across UI, features, community, and monetization, it’s evident that each platform has its weaknesses. This leads us to look at the bigger picture: what gaps exist in the market due to these weaknesses, and how could a new app address them?
Competitive Weaknesses and Market Gaps
Despite the variety of tracking apps available, many users feel that none of them fully satisfy their needs. As one Redditor put it after extensive experimentation: “I’ve tried at least 3 dozen TV/Movie tracking apps. There isn’t a single one that doesn’t have at least 1 or 2 huge dealbreaker problems.”
 This is a striking statement – it suggests a significant market gap waiting to be filled by an app that can eliminate those dealbreakers. Let’s summarize the key weaknesses of current competitors and the gaps those create:
TV Time: Strengths include an easy-to-use interface for marking episodes, a large catalog (leveraging TVDB), and a big user community for popular shows. Its weaknesses are severe though: ongoing bugs and performance issues, lack of meaningful updates (some users feel the devs “don’t care about the app at all” anymore
), and no openness (no public API or easy data export without jumping through hoops). TV Time also leans more toward TV content, having only in recent years started to also track movies. For movie enthusiasts, TV Time’s features (and community) are relatively sparse compared to Letterboxd. Market gap: A stable, well-maintained app with a similar breadth of features and ease of use could steal TV Time’s thunder. Many are essentially waiting for something better to come along – indeed, posts like “Has anyone switched from TV Time to another app?”
 are common, indicating a readiness to jump ship if a viable alternative exists. Right now, people patch together solutions (e.g., using TV Time + Trakt in parallel
) to mitigate TV Time’s flaws.
Trakt: Trakt’s core strength is its comprehensive tracking engine and ecosystem – it’s the de facto backend for numerous apps (Showly, CineTrak, Media center plugins, etc.), and it covers both movies and TV. It also syncs with many third-party tools. Its weaknesses center on user-facing experience: the official app’s design decisions (removing some conveniences) have been contentious
, the community features are minimal, and recent monetization moves angered its most loyal users
. Additionally, depending on TMDB data has introduced those chronology issues and occasional content lags (e.g., TMDB’s movie database is great, but if a TV entry isn’t updated promptly, Trakt waits on it). Trakt is powerful, but some view it as too hardcore or not user-friendly enough for casual users – one review called the interface “overly complex and busy”, not well suited for a casual movie fan just wanting to log stuff
. Market gap: There’s room for a service as powerful as Trakt but more approachable and without the recent PR baggage. Also, since Trakt is now more expensive, a competitor that offers similar utility at a lower price (or with a different model) could attract cost-conscious users. Trakt’s recent turmoil actually spawned threads titled “What are our alternatives?” where long-time users share other options
 – evidence that a portion of Trakt’s user base might jump if they find a service that feels more respectful or user-centric.
Letterboxd: Letterboxd is the clear leader for film tracking/reviews, with a strong brand and community. Its limitation is content scope (no episodic TV support, at least not yet) – which means any serious TV watcher can’t rely on Letterboxd alone. There’s also a segment of users who simply don’t gel with the social vibe or UI, as seen by comments from a few who “can’t get into Letterboxd at all” and prefer IMDb’s utilitarian approach
. But overall, Letterboxd’s weaknesses are fewer in the tracking space; it’s more that it doesn’t directly compete on TV tracking. Market gap: The obvious one is a “Letterboxd for TV”, which some new apps (Serializd, Reelgood’s tracked content feature, etc.) are trying to be. If Letterboxd itself integrates TV, it could dominate that combined space, but until then, there’s an opportunity for another app to be the go-to for series the way Letterboxd is for films. Also, if an app could combine both movies and TV into one experience (with a slick social component), it might draw users who are currently splitting their time between Letterboxd and a TV-centric tracker.
JustWatch/Reelgood: These are great for what they do (aggregating streaming availability and letting you manage a universal watchlist across services). Their weakness is that they are not optimized for tracking your watching progress or recording your thoughts. They’re missing many of the “tracker” features like marking individual episodes, scoring/reviewing what you watched, getting insights on your viewing habits, etc.
. They also tend to be more utilitarian (not much of a social community built around them). Market gap: There is a convergence opportunity between discovery tools and tracking tools. As one user imagined, combining JustWatch’s streaming guide with TV Time’s tracking UI would create a powerhouse app
. Right now, users often use JustWatch alongside one of the above tracking apps. A new entrant that could eliminate the need to bounce between a “where to watch” app and a “what I watched” app would save users time and effort. Notably, the founder of Trakt even mentioned working on better JustWatch integration before – showing recognition that linking those functions is valuable
. But currently, the gap remains: if you want both great tracking and great discovery in one, you won’t find it.
Other Competitors (Serializd, Simkl, Hobi, etc.): Each smaller competitor has its niche but also weaknesses. For example, Simkl markets itself as a comprehensive tracker, but some users found its interface clunky and, like Trakt, it suffered the same “specials in a separate bin” problem (at least at one point)
. Hobi is a stylish mobile app for TV, but it’s limited to TV and is mobile-only (no web platform), and some users report it’s more for casual use (less feature-rich than TV Time). SeriesGuide (Android only) is lightweight and reliable, but purely utilitarian with no cloud sync unless paired with Trakt, and no social or discovery features. Next Episode is a web/mobile tracker that some rave is “stable and functional as hell”
, but it’s quite old-school in design and focuses only on TV shows, with manual checks for new episodes (no personalized recommendations, etc.). Moviebase, Cinexplore, Watchworthy, Queue, and others each try to improve on aspects of the experience (some focus on recommendations, some on stats, some on UI), but often they piggyback on Trakt or TMDB data and therefore inherit certain limitations. A telling comment from a Reddit user about Cinexplore: “like TV Time, it’s 85% exactly what I want, and 15% aggravating – just different exact wants and aggravations.”
 In other words, even the best alternative he found was still 15% frustrating. Multiply that by dozens of apps, and it’s clear why people feel the “perfect app” doesn’t exist.
To illustrate the state of the market, one user summarized their ideal “perfect app” by cherry-picking features from several services: “TV Time, exactly as it is, with its overall UI/UX and handling of episode order … PLUS JustWatch’s streaming options UI … PLUS Cinexplore’s handling of personal notes and cast/crew info … PLUS [another app’s] handling of watch dates … PLUS [an option to] ignore articles in titles for sorting … PLUS dates (not just countdowns) for upcoming releases.”
 They concluded: “Honestly, if TV Time added JustWatch’s streaming options interface and fixed the alphabetization, I’d never look at another show-tracking app again.”
 This wishlist reveals the gaps: no app currently combines an excellent UI, complete tracking features (with notes, custom sorting), full streaming info integration, and polished UX details like proper sorting and flexible date displays. Another broad gap in the market is user trust and goodwill. Some incumbents have squandered this (e.g., Trakt with its pricing drama). There’s an opening for a new app to present itself as user-friendly, transparent, and responsive to feedback. As one user said in a discussion about the lack of a perfect app: “The perfect TV tracking app just doesn’t exist... which is surprising considering the amount of cord-cutters today.”
 People see that with so many folks watching so much content across streaming services, a killer tracking app should be out there. The fact that many are still unhappy with what’s available suggests the first app to truly address these lingering pain points could capture a hungry audience. In short, the competitive weaknesses of current apps – whether it’s TV Time’s bugginess, Trakt’s monetization, Letterboxd’s no-TV limitation, or JustWatch’s lack of tracking features – create an environment where users are actively looking for a better solution. The market gaps identified include: a unified movies+TV platform, an app that prioritizes stability and user control, one that blends tracking with discovery, and one that adopts a fair monetization model. These represent opportunities for differentiation.
Opportunities for Differentiation in a New Tracking App
Given the laundry list of pain points above, a new entrant in this space has a clear roadmap of what not to do. By directly addressing user frustrations, a new app could differentiate itself and attract users eager for a better experience. Here are some key opportunities, distilled from the complaints we’ve seen: 1. Rock-Solid Stability and Support: Simply being reliable could be a killer feature. Users are tired of apps that crash, freeze, or glitch during basic tasks. A new app that invests in thorough testing (perhaps a lengthy beta with user feedback) and delivers a fast, smooth experience will stand out. As one user pithily said of TV Time, it’s “a great app… when it works!”
. The bar has been set low in this regard – many are so frustrated they’d flock to an app that just works consistently on both iOS and Android. Swift, responsive support is part of this too: being known as the app that quickly fixes data errors or bugs (where TV Time and others have been non-responsive
) would build trust. Essentially, make reliability a core feature – it may not be flashy, but it’s desperately needed. 2. Unified Movie and TV Tracking: There’s a golden opportunity to combine what Letterboxd and TV Time do into one unified platform. Users don’t want to maintain separate logs for films and series. A new app that treats movies, ongoing TV shows, limited series, and even other formats (documentaries, web shorts, etc.) under one roof would immediately attract those bouncing between apps. Letterboxd’s absence of TV support is a huge gap ready to be filled
. If the new app could import someone’s Letterboxd film diary and also import their TV Time/Trakt show list, that user could have everything in one place for the first time. Being the “one app to rule them all” (for all visual media tracking) is a strong differentiator. It’s challenging – it means dealing with multiple data sources and potentially complex UI (movies don’t have episodes; shows do) – but the demand is clearly there. 3. Superior Data Handling and Customization: The new app can win over detail-oriented users by solving the metadata issues others have struggled with. This means using a reliable database (or combining sources like TMDB and TVDB) to ensure complete and accurate listings of episodes (including specials, OVAs, bonus content) in the correct order. Offering users some control here could be a game-changer. For example, allow an option to treat “special” episodes as part of the main watchlist (for those who want to see everything chronologically)
, or conversely, an option to hide or separate them for those who don’t care. That flexibility would address the Doctor Who scenario that drove some away from Trakt
. Additionally, including data that others omit, like full cast and crew info at the episode level, is an opportunity. TV Time notably lacks crew credits (director/writer info)
, which film buffs and TV nerds do care about. A new app that lets you tap an episode and see not just a summary but who directed it, who guest-starred (and maybe even integrates with a site like IMDb or Wikipedia for one-click deeper info) would delight those users who currently juggle multiple apps to get that detail. Another customization: personal notes and tags for any entry. Many users want a field to jot down “why this is on my list” or “who recommended it”
 – implementing that (with privacy by default, unlike Letterboxd where lists/reviews are public) could draw in the planners and note-takers. And of course, fix the little things: allow sorting ignoring “A/An/The”
, allow marking a show as “abandoned” or an episode as “skipped”, allow logging re-watches properly (perhaps prompting for dates or tracking how many times watched). Each of these exists in one app or another, but no app has all of them. Being the first to cover all these bases would check a lot of user wishlist boxes. 4. Easy Migration (Import/Export): This is a huge opportunity to win goodwill. Users are practically begging for an easier way to move their data
. A new app that offers one-click import from the major services (TV Time, Trakt, Letterboxd, IMDb watchlist, maybe even CSV files) will lower the barrier for curious users to try it out. Simkl has the right idea here by building import tools
; a new app should do the same, perhaps even improving on it with an in-app wizard: “Connect your accounts and import your watched history.” If privacy or API limitations make direct import tricky, even providing a well-documented method or assistance (and export in a standard format like CSV or JSON for transparency) would signal that this app doesn’t believe in trapping users’ data. Considering how many people said they stayed with a subpar app only because migrating was too exhausting
, removing that obstacle can rapidly build a user base. Users will feel safer investing time into a new platform if they know they can leave with their data intact if needed. In a landscape where others seem to use lock-in as a retention tactic, a new app’s philosophy of data portability would sharply differentiate it. 5. Integrated Discovery and Streaming Info: Bridging the gap between tracking and discovery could be a signature feature. A new app can take inspiration from JustWatch/Reelgood by integrating a streaming availability guide. For example, when you view a movie or show entry, the app could show where it’s currently streaming (with filters for region, free/subscription). Even better, allow users to set their streaming service subscriptions in their profile and then filter availability accordingly – e.g., “show me where I can watch this with my existing subscriptions.” This addresses a user complaint that some apps show services they don’t care about (paid VOD they’ll never use) without ability to filter
. If this app can incorporate a robust database of where titles are available (either via licensing JustWatch’s API or another source), it saves users from hopping out to another app or Google. Moreover, add features like notifying users when something on their watchlist hits a streaming service. JustWatch Pro does this, I believe, but a lot of people would love to have it combined with their tracker. On the recommendation side, the app should leverage its data to suggest what to watch next. Many users loved TV Time’s recommendations
; a new app should definitely have a recommendation engine (perhaps even an AI-driven or collaborative filtering one to stand out). Given the data it collects on user tastes, it could cross-recommend TV shows based on movies liked and vice versa – something few do because apps are siloed to one domain. There’s also an opportunity for discovery modes: maybe a curated “Popular this week on your services” or editorial lists (Letterboxd does community lists very well; a new app could encourage user-made lists or integrate RottenTomatoes/IMDB top lists for exploration). Essentially, becoming a one-stop app for “What should I watch and what have I watched” is the endgame. Users have explicitly wished for the fusion of tracking and discovery interfaces
 – the first app to nail that will have an edge. 6. Balanced Social Features (Opt-in Community): As discussed, users are split on social elements. The opportunity here is to design a social experience that is customizable and non-intrusive. A new app could allow users to toggle the visibility of a social feed on their home screen. For those who want community, provide features like episode discussion threads (a la TV Time), movie reviews and ratings (a la Letterboxd), the ability to follow friends and see a feed of what they watch or review. But importantly, also provide filters and controls: e.g., a setting to only show reviews from people you follow (reducing noise from random joke reviews), or a content filter to hide spoilers and toxic language (maybe via community moderation or automated detection). The app could even innovate by having thematic discussion groups or integrating with existing communities (like pulling in Reddit discussions for an episode – though that’s tricky to do well). Meanwhile, for users who couldn’t care less about social, the app should let them default to a purely personal dashboard (just their shows/movies, upcoming releases, etc.). This way, the app caters to both demographics – something current apps don’t fully do. Notifying users of direct interactions is easy low-hanging fruit (if someone comments on your review or follows you, you should get a notification – TV Time dropping the ball here is an example to improve upon
). By having an opt-in social model, the app can advertise community features without alienating those who prefer solo use. This could be a strong differentiator: all the social functionality if you want it, but none of the pressure or feed clutter if you don’t. Considering one user’s praise that “TV Time lets you go [to the social features] if you want to”
, that principle can be a design guideline. 7. Fair and Transparent Monetization: Finally, a new app has a huge opportunity to earn goodwill by doing monetization in a user-friendly way. This means avoiding sudden massive price hikes or paywalling basic features that have been free historically. Options could include: a reasonable subscription (say, $1–3 per month or $10–20 per year) that offers genuinely useful perks but doesn’t hamstring free users; or a one-time purchase model for certain features (like Cinexplore’s inexpensive premium unlock
). The key is to communicate clearly why supporting the app is worthwhile. For instance, if the app has no ads for anyone (the ideal scenario), explain that a premium sub supports the costs and maybe offers cosmetic bonuses and advanced stats in return. If it uses ads on free accounts, ensure they are non-intrusive (no full-screen takeovers, no auto-redirecting to browser as Letterboxd’s did
). Perhaps limit ads to certain sections or allow an in-app banner rather than disruptive interstitials. Also, explicitly promise data portability and no lock-in even for free users – this builds trust that you’re not holding their data hostage for ransom. By treating users with respect, a new app can differentiate itself from competitors that are seen as money-grabbing or increasingly greedy
. A smart move could be offering a loyalty or founding member discount to early adopters (avoiding Trakt’s mistake of revoking grandfathered pricing and angering veterans
). Show that you value long-term supporters. In essence, make users feel like stakeholders, not sources of cash to be squeezed. This intangible goodwill can be a big competitive advantage – people will evangelize an app that they feel does right by them, especially in contrast to others that have let them down (e.g., many former Trakt VIPs publicly vented and canceled – a new app could capture that sentiment by offering a refuge with fair pricing). In conclusion, a new tracking app can stand out by being the anti-hero to all these common complaints. Focus on stability, encompass all content, be obsessively user-focused in features, embrace interoperability (imports) rather than walled gardens, blend tracking with discovery, and adopt a fair monetization strategy. The user community has essentially drawn a roadmap through their complaints. As one user observed, “the perfect app just doesn’t exist… which is surprising”
 – but it could exist if an app listens to what people have been asking for. By learning from the missteps of TV Time, Trakt, JustWatch, Letterboxd, and others, a new entrant could carve out a devoted following and fill this gap in the market. The appetite for a better solution is clearly there, as evidenced by the countless forum threads of frustrated users. Whichever app manages to address these pain points will likely find an enthusiastic audience ready to champion it. Sources:

User Frustrations with Popular Movie & TV Tracking Apps (TV Time, Trakt, JustWatch, Letterboxd, etc.)
Tracking the movies and TV shows you watch should be convenient and fun – but according to many users, today’s popular tracking apps often fall short. This deep dive examines common complaints voiced by U.S. users about TV Time, Trakt, JustWatch, Letterboxd, and similar competitors. We’ll highlight recurring pain points (with real user examples) and categorize them into themes like UI/UX problems, syncing/data issues, feature gaps, community frustrations, and monetization woes. We’ll also identify competitive weaknesses and opportunities for a new app to differentiate itself while focusing on the core value: helping people track their watched content without hassle.
UI/UX Frustrations and Design Changes
A smooth and intuitive interface is critical for tracking apps, yet users often gripe about UI/UX missteps:
Cluttered or Confusing Interfaces: Several apps have been accused of becoming too busy or less user-friendly over time. For instance, JustWatch received backlash after an update replaced its simple, tabular list of streaming options with a “clunky, confusing” layout seemingly biased toward Apple’s ecosystem
. One movie buff vented that the change “destroyed the only thing [JustWatch was] good for,” wishing for an alternative service
. Similarly, Trakt’s newly redesigned mobile app (launched after “Trakt Lite” beta) is seen as less intuitive than the old version. A long-time Trakt VIP said the new UI “feels less intuitive” and “is still currently missing things I use all the time,” such as easy navigation to the next episode and certain sorting options
. In their words: “It is a very good looking UI, but most of the functionality that I utilize is missing.”
 This exemplifies form overtaking function – a visually modern design that sacrifices beloved features.
Too Many Steps for Basic Actions: A frequent complaint is when simple tasks require extra taps or scrolling. TV Time is often praised for its straightforward design (e.g. swipe to mark an episode watched) and clear “Up Next” list. Competing apps sometimes lack these conveniences. “Some have really pretty interfaces with lots of info but [lack] a simple way to swipe to mark [episodes] off,” one user noted
. They found many alternatives cumbersome: “Many require so many steps just to say you watched an episode.”
 Users clearly value quick, direct interactions – and notice when an app buries core functionality in menus.
Interface Changes Received Poorly: The maxim “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” comes up in user feedback. Letterboxd’s Android app underwent major changes in late 2025, which hardcore users vehemently disliked. According to one reviewer, “the changes to the UI make little sense and have ended up worsening the user experience, making the overall appearance far clunkier. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it – and the original app was far from broke.”
 Features were moved or removed in ways that frustrated loyal users. For example, Letterboxd’s app no longer showed a movie’s top reviews by default (instead prioritizing an endless cast list), and even basic navigation like swiping the screen edge to go back was disabled. “Why on earth would you take that away…?” one user asked, noting the app became “buggy as hell” in the process
.
Platform Inconsistencies: Users also point out when an app’s experience differs across platforms. Letterboxd again is a case in point – its iOS app has generally been polished, but the Android app was historically lagging. One Redditor (also a paying Patron) called the Android app “garbage in terms of UI/UX” and “an insult for their paying Android users,” especially when comparing it to the smoother iOS version
. This disparity in quality left Android users feeling second-class. Consistency is key: a tracking app needs to deliver a comparable, high-quality interface on all devices to avoid alienating part of its audience.
In summary, UI/UX complaints range from unwelcome redesigns to navigation inefficiencies. Users want clean, intuitive layouts that make tracking effortless – and they react loudly when updates seem to prioritize aesthetics or new features at the expense of practicality. The best interfaces are those that stay out of the way and let people quickly log and find information (episodes, reviews, etc.) without confusion.
Performance and Stability Issues
Even the richest feature set means little if the app doesn’t run smoothly. Unfortunately, many users report that reliability is a major pain point:
Crashes, Freezes and Slowdowns: TV Time in particular garners reports of lag and instability. “The app has become slow and buggy,” one longtime user lamented
. Another frustrated user on Android described how the app “just won’t load” at times – it freezes up, forcing them to uninstall and reinstall repeatedly just to use it
. That fix only lasts a few days before TV Time locks up again. “It’s a great app… when it works!” they added, highlighting how unreliable performance undercuts an otherwise beloved tool
. Such sentiments (“great when it actually works”) are echoed by many, indicating stability has become TV Time’s Achilles’ heel.
Sync and Update Failures: Users also encounter issues where actions don’t register or data doesn’t update in a timely fashion. For example, TV Time sometimes fails to mark episodes as watched or to remove them from the queue. “Sometimes, when I mark an episode as watched, it doesn’t disappear,” one user noted, describing a bug that undermines the whole point of a tracking app
. Others mention that TV Time will erroneously show incorrect episode counts (e.g. saying two episodes aired when only one did)
. These glitches force users to double-check or refresh repeatedly. Trakt’s new app has had hiccups too: a user in September 2025 reported it was “buggy as hell”, giving “unexpected response” errors whenever they tried to open a movie from their diary
. And over on Letterboxd, a formerly smooth app became “pretty much unusable” for some Android users – crashing during basic actions like writing a review or searching for a film, and throwing numerous error messages within a single week of use
. It’s clear that frequent bugs or technical issues drive users away in frustration.
Notification Problems: Part of “stability” for these apps is reliably notifying users about new episodes or messages. Here, TV Time again drew complaints: “After a while [my] TV Time notifications stopped working,” one user wrote, noting they no longer received alerts when new episodes aired
. Multiple people confirmed this issue, saying notifications had been broken for months on end
. For an app that advertises episode alerts as a feature, that’s a serious failing – and indeed some users left for Trakt or other solutions specifically because they “loved TV Time” but couldn’t tolerate missing notifications
. Trakt’s app has its own notification gaps (e.g. no push notification for friend activity or comments, since the community aspect is minimal), but the outright failure of promised alerts in TV Time was a top frustration.
General Reliability Concerns: Put simply, many users feel these apps can’t be counted on day-to-day. One person remarked in late 2025, “I’ve used this app since it was launched; the quality during the last year has really been going down.”
 That sentiment – that an app is deteriorating or being neglected – is fatal to user confidence. In the case of TV Time, some even wondered if the app was “dead” or abandoned by its developers due to the mounting bugs and lack of prompt fixes
. When basic interactions like marking a show or loading one’s list don’t work half the time, users naturally start searching for alternatives. As one new Trakt user put it: they switched because they were “so very tired of TV Time only working like half the time.”
 Reliability was more valuable to them than any specific feature TV Time offered.
In short, performance and stability issues – crashes, freezes, unresponsive features, broken notifications – are a major source of pain. Many users are not experiencing these apps as fire-and-forget utilities; instead, they’re spending time troubleshooting, reinstalling, and contacting support. An app that can deliver consistency and stability would directly address one of the loudest complaints in this space (“mess with it less, watch more” would be a welcome motto).
Data Accuracy and Syncing Woes
Under the hood, tracking apps rely on vast databases of shows and movies. When those data aren’t handled well, users notice. Common grievances include incorrect episode information, missing titles, poor syncing between services, and difficulty migrating one’s watch history. Key examples:
Episode Order & “Specials” Handling: A very specific but passionate complaint comes from fans of shows with non-standard episode structures (like holiday specials or OVAs). Trakt and any app that relies on its data (which comes from TheMovieDB) have a known issue: all special episodes get lumped into a separate “Specials” season, breaking chronological order. For series like Doctor Who or Futurama, which have critical story episodes that are technically “specials,” this is a dealbreaker. One power-user ranted that Trakt is “the absolute worst” for managing chronology of such shows – “literally impossible” to track them in order
. He noted Trakt’s team knows about the problem but “refuse to fix it,” instead telling users to create custom lists as a workaround
. His stance: “Any app that uses Trakt is an instant uninstall for me.”
 This highlights a data integrity gap: serious TV enthusiasts want a tracker that preserves the true watch order, including specials. By contrast, TV Time (which uses TVDB data) often does integrate specials into the normal episode list correctly
. That’s one reason some hardcore fans grudgingly stick with TV Time despite its other flaws – it “just gets” the episode ordering right for their favorite shows
. As another user summarized after testing dozens of apps: “Trakt…apps [are] riddled with [the] series chronology problem” and therefore unusable for certain shows
. This is a niche issue, but it’s repeatedly brought up on forums – a new app that nails episode ordering (perhaps by offering the option to merge specials into main seasons) could win the loyalty of this vocal group.
Missing or Stale Data: Users also complain when a tracker’s database doesn’t have a show or movie they’re looking for, or adds it too slowly. Trakt’s reliance on TMDB means it occasionally lacks niche or very new content. As one reviewer noted, “the app works off of TMDB which is less accurate than IMDb for niche shows/movies.” They gave an example that they sometimes have to wait a while before a new season or obscure movie is added to Trakt’s catalog, leaving them unable to mark it as watched
. JustWatch too has gaps – a Reddit user pointed out that at one point it wasn’t showing Tubi (a free streaming service) as an option, whereas previously it had
. Whether that was a temporary bug or a deliberate omission, it signaled to users that JustWatch’s once-comprehensive coverage could be faltering. TV Time, despite owning TVDB, has had issues with data syncing as well. Users mention instances where they correct info on TVDB’s site, but “the TV Time database does not sync correctly” to reflect the fix
. In those cases, one must contact TV Time support to update a series manually – and “most of the time they don’t even respond,” according to a frustrated user
. All these scenarios boil down to trust: users want to trust that the app’s data is complete and up-to-date without them having to beg for fixes.
Cross-Platform Sync (or Lack Thereof): Many movie/TV buffs use multiple services and integrations (for example, a media center like Plex scrobbling watches to Trakt, or logging films on Letterboxd but shows on another app). Sync issues in this context are another pain point. One Trakt beta user listed as a complaint that the new app “doesn’t show a live in-progress scrobble anymore for Plex or Jellyfin.”
 For those who enjoyed seeing what their media center was currently playing via Trakt’s interface, the feature’s removal was disappointing. Additionally, siloed ecosystems make life harder: Letterboxd and Trakt don’t sync with each other (though some third-party tools exist), and TV Time is a closed system altogether. There is a noticeable desire for consolidation or easy data transfer between services – which leads to the next point.
Import/Export and Data Portability: A huge friction point expressed by long-term users is the difficulty of migrating their watch history from one app to another. Many feel “locked in” to a platform where they’ve logged years’ worth of shows, because exporting that data (or importing it elsewhere) is cumbersome if it’s possible at all. “I would consider using another app if there was an import feature,” admitted one TV Time veteran, “At this point I’ve been using TV Time for so long that I’m invested.”
 This user and others describe the exhausting manual work required to move hundreds of entries. TV Time does allow users to request an export of their data, but the process seems unreliable – one person requested their data export multiple times, only receiving it after “the third time” and a long wait
. They suspected TV Time’s team might be dragging their feet “hoping we forget about it.”
 Even when you get your data, importing it into a new service (like Trakt or Simkl) might require third-party scripts or tools that average users won’t bother with. This is why we see posts like “I have so many movies and series watched that I just give up after a few days [of trying to switch] and go back to TV Time.”
 People feel trapped by the lack of easy data transfer. Some alternative services have recognized this demand – e.g. Simkl touts a 2-second import from TV Time, Trakt, IMDb, etc.
 – but the mainstream apps have yet to make migration truly seamless.
In summary, data-related issues cause frustration on multiple fronts: (1) How well the app’s database covers and orders content (especially tricky TV metadata), (2) How well it keeps that data in sync and up-to-date, and (3) Whether it lets users take their data elsewhere. Users want accuracy (no missing episodes, correct info), consistency (one source of truth across platforms), and control of their data. Apps that fail in these areas either force users into awkward workarounds or simply drive them away to competitors that promise better data handling.
Missing Features and Functional Gaps
Beyond bugs and data issues, users also identify feature gaps – capabilities or content they wish these apps had (or had not removed). Repeated gripes include limited tracking features, poor discovery tools, and other missing “nice to haves”:
No Support for TV (in Letterboxd): Perhaps the biggest content gap mentioned is Letterboxd’s lack of television tracking. Letterboxd is loved among cinephiles for logging films, but it pointedly does not support TV episodes or series (with a few rare exceptions for miniseries). Users frequently mention this as a “huge minus” that “makes the app feel incomplete.”
 Many don’t want to maintain a separate IMDb or TV Time account just for shows. On Reddit, multiple people expressed hope that “if Letterboxd got series,” they’d ditch other apps entirely
. In fact, in 2024 the Letterboxd team did hint that TV support is on the horizon, but as of now it’s not implemented
. This gap (movies vs. TV) is a fundamental one – it essentially splits users’ logging between platforms and is seen as a big opportunity for improvement. A single app that can elegantly handle both movies and TV would solve this complaint for many users.
Limited Episode Tracking Features in Some Apps: On the flip side, some movie-oriented or general trackers don’t have features that dedicated TV trackers do. For example, JustWatch allows creating a watchlist and marking items as seen, but it doesn’t support per-episode tracking or “progress” within a series in a meaningful way
. A user who tried JustWatch for tracking noted it “does not have a 'watched up to here' option, can’t log rewatches, can’t mark episodes as skipped, has very little episode detail…”
. Essentially, JustWatch is great for finding content to watch, but not for granularly tracking how far you are in a show or your episode-by-episode reactions. Similarly, some Trakt-based apps were criticized for lacking options like marking a show as “dropped” or tracking re-watches properly
. One user comparing many services praised TV Time for including features like “watched up to here” (marking progress if you’ve seen episodes out of order) and a “stopped watching” (dropped) status
 – features that others like Serializd initially didn’t have or emphasize
. If an app doesn’t allow these common user actions, it feels incomplete to serious trackers.
Customization and Personal Notes: A much-requested feature is the ability to add private notes or tags to entries. Users want to record why they added something to their list (e.g. “recommended by so-and-so” or “won award X”) or where/when they watched it. TV Time currently does not offer personal note-taking, which one detailed post flagged as a major shortcoming: “No personal notes option (impossible to remind yourself why you added a title).”
 Trakt actually does allow notes on list items – but only for VIP subscribers – and in the new mobile app those private notes were initially missing altogether (to be added later)
. For now, users have noticed their notes are inaccessible, which is frustrating. The desire for custom notes goes hand-in-hand with more sorting and filtering options. For example, being able to sort one’s watchlist by personal rating, or filter by a tag (“comedies”, “recommendations from John”, etc.). Letterboxd offers tags and some filtering on web, but users say its tagging system needs an overhaul
 and that finding or managing lists in the app can be difficult (one person wished “finding new lists was easier in the app” instead of seeing only the same popular lists
). Overall, trackers could do better at letting users organize and annotate their content beyond simple “watched” checkmarks.
Discovery & Recommendations (or Lack Thereof): Users often care not just about tracking what they’ve seen, but discovering what to watch next. TV Time earned praise in this area – its personalized recommendations based on viewing history are described as “always spot on” by some fans
. By contrast, a competitor like Serializd (a newer TV tracking social app) was called out for having no recommendations at all
. “It also doesn’t have any recommendations, and that’s a shame,” one user wrote, saying they missed TV Time’s suggestion engine
. JustWatch and Reelgood focus on discovery (showing what’s trending or newly added on services), but they don’t personalize it deeply to your watched list unless you pay for certain features. If a tracking app lacks robust discovery tools – like recommendation feeds, similar show suggestions, or trend highlights – users might find it “feature poor” compared to others. Conversely, if it leans too much into discovery at the expense of tracking, that can annoy users who just want to log and go (this balance is tricky).
Notifications and Calendar Features: A few feature suggestions point to gaps in notification and calendar functions. One Google Play review of TV Time requested a feature to notify the user about upcoming releases for items on their watchlist
. In other words, if you add an upcoming movie or a TV series that hasn’t premiered yet, the app could remind you when it becomes available. This is a sensible extension of tracking into planning, but not all apps offer it. (TV Time does notify you of new episodes for followed shows – when it’s working – but it doesn’t proactively remind you of, say, a series premiere you marked interest in, nor does Letterboxd/Trakt in their current forms.) The same reviewer also wished for a way to jump to a specific month in their calendar/watchlist, instead of endless scrolling
 – a QoL feature for those who have large watchlists scheduled out. These may seem like small misses, but for heavy users they represent daily friction that adds up.
Streaming Availability Info In-App: Another gap some users noted is the integration of “where to watch” information directly into the tracking app. TV Time, Trakt, and Letterboxd have all dabbled in this but not to the extent of dedicated services like JustWatch. For instance, TV Time does list some streaming options for shows, but one user complained it excludes certain library services (Hoopla, Kanopy) and doesn’t indicate which options are free, subscription, or require purchase
. “Watch options have no information about free vs subscription vs buying or prices,” they wrote, and noted that some options (like Microsoft Store or Fandango) always show up but can’t be filtered out
. This made TV Time’s built-in guide “less than helpful for finding streaming sources.”
 The absence of a robust streaming search within these apps is a gap often filled by using JustWatch/Reelgood separately. As one person mused about the “perfect app”: “TV Time, exactly as it is… PLUS JustWatch’s streaming options UI…” would be ideal
. The fact that users are wishing for mash-ups of features from different apps shows that each app alone has gaps that another covers.
Other Miscellany: A few more minor feature complaints include the inability to rate or review individual episodes on some platforms (Letterboxd doesn’t do TV at all; Trakt allows episode comments/ratings, TV Time allows episode ratings/reactions). Some Trakt users were annoyed that the new app removed links to external sites like IMDb or TVDB for more info on an episode
, which they used to rely on. Others miss seeing certain stats – e.g. Trakt’s app redesign hid total watch time and some profile statistics
, which VIP users enjoyed. And in TV Time’s case, some “original” features were removed and later restored after outcry: one user remembered a period about five years ago when TV Time’s big UI revamp temporarily removed the indicator showing how many episodes you have left (+X) and which episode number you’re on for each show
. The community demanded it back, as it’s a highly useful at-a-glance feature, and TV Time did re-introduce it. This anecdote shows that even seemingly small features (like an episode countdown) are dearly missed if taken away – emphasizing how carefully a tracking app must expand without regressing on the basics.
Overall, feature gaps and omissions become glaring once users have experienced a competitor that offers that functionality. No app in this space is feature-complete in the eyes of the community. Whether it’s content coverage (TV vs movies), tracking granularity, organizational tools, or discovery aids, each platform leaves some users wanting more. These gaps represent both frustrations for users and potential opportunities for any app that can fill them.
Community and Social Friction
One interesting aspect of movie/TV tracking apps is the social component. Some, like Letterboxd, thrive as social networks for media lovers; others, like Trakt, are more utilitarian with light social features tacked on. Users have raised various issues about community features – from toxic comments to lack of interaction – and clearly differ in how much “social” they want with their tracking:
TV Time’s Half-Baked Community: TV Time tries to foster a community with episode discussion threads, polls (favorite characters, how an episode made you feel), and even “groups.” However, users find the social tools a bit lacking. “TV Time…barely has community even though it tries to promote ‘groups’,” one user observed
. There is no way to directly message other users, and the app does not send notifications for new followers or replies – so interactions feel limited
. Users described the experience as “lonely” despite the large number of users on the platform
. Essentially, you can comment on episodes and get replies, but the app doesn’t do much to build connections – you might never know if someone followed you or responded, without manually checking. This limits the sense of community. Some also note the discussion quality on TV Time can be mixed; while many enjoy reading comments from other fans, others have encountered trolls or spoilers (TV Time attempts to keep comments spoiler-free for those not caught up, which is a plus). One user did mention seeing “some hateful comments” on TV Time, though they called it rare
. The lack of moderation tools like a robust blocking system is another issue – indeed someone reported that TV Time’s “blocking feature doesn’t work” properly (you still get notifications from people you blocked)
. All this indicates that TV Time’s social features, while present, have friction and shortcomings that leave users underwhelmed.
Trakt’s Sparse Social Scene: Trakt is almost the opposite of TV Time – historically it’s been more of a backend service, with less emphasis on in-app social interaction. There is a feed where you can see friends’ watching activity and you can write comments or reviews on shows/episodes, but the engagement level is low. One user stated plainly that the community in Trakt “is not much into comments.” They use Trakt for tracking, but “when I want to comment on something or see other people's comments I always check TV Time because the community in Trakt is [quiet].”
 This suggests Trakt feels empty on the social side – likely because it doesn’t have the volume of openly social users, and many people use Trakt passively (or via other apps) just to sync data. In fact, some threads on r/trakt are full of users swapping Trakt for Letterboxd or TV Time specifically to get more social features or better discussion. Trakt’s design also doesn’t push social interaction; for example, it doesn’t highlight popular reviews prominently the way Letterboxd does, and its forums are external (on a separate community site). The general sentiment is that Trakt is great for tracking, not for talking. This is a weakness for those who do want a social element – they might use Trakt in combination with something else to fulfill that need.
Letterboxd’s Vibrant (But Occasionally Frustrating) Community: Letterboxd is widely praised for its active social community around films. Users love reading each other’s reviews, liking and commenting, and the playful social dynamics (inside jokes, meme reviews, etc.). However, not everything is perfect. Some users complain about the content of the community – e.g., too many silly one-liner reviews cluttering the feed. “Having to scroll through dozens of reviews to see actual reviews that say anything, not just ‘this happened to my buddy Eric’ or ‘these characters are so gay’,” one user listed as a downside
. In other words, Letterboxd’s open community means quality control is up to the user – you have to curate who you follow or endure a lot of jokey content in the popular review section. Additionally, there are a few functional complaints: the “News from friends” feed on Letterboxd only shows the last 12 items, meaning if you follow active people, you might miss a lot of their activity unless you check each friend’s page
. And the Friends Activity page can get dominated by a few power users, making it less useful if your network isn’t balanced
. These are fairly specific issues, but they highlight that even in the gold-standard social tracking app, users have wishes for improvement (like better filtering of friend activity, or separate feeds for reviews vs. logs). It’s worth noting that Letterboxd lacks any direct messaging or group feature – all interaction is public comments or likes. This keeps the focus on content (films and reviews) rather than personal chat, which many like, but it means if someone wanted to, say, have a private discussion or form a small book-club-like circle, Letterboxd alone doesn’t provide that. In the context of our analysis, Letterboxd’s main “gap” is not community size or engagement (it’s strong there), but rather the scope (no TV, as mentioned) and some social UX quirks.
Niche App Communities (Serializd, etc.): Some newer entrants try to combine tracking with a social feed. Serializd (often described as “Letterboxd for TV”) has a feed where you see reviews and reactions from the community. Users have noted pros and cons: it has a modern interface and a growing user base, but “there are not many reviews or nuanced discussion” yet due to the smaller community
. It also “seems to be populated by younger people,” which one user said is fine but sometimes means the shows aren’t discussed “seriously” or with depth
. The same user did appreciate Serializd’s interface and features, but ultimately found TV Time’s larger community provided more “nuance” (more varied opinions) – albeit with the downside of some toxic comments slipping through
. Another user who started using Serializd mentioned it felt “lonely” unless you happen to be watching whatever is currently popular
. This underscores a challenge for any new app: until you reach critical mass of users, the “community” features can feel empty or “quiet” to the point of loneliness. People join these platforms partly to see others’ reactions – if the content they care about isn’t generating discussion due to a small user pool, the community feature isn’t delivering value.
Social vs. Solo Experience – Different User Preferences: It’s important to highlight that not all users want a social experience from their tracking app. Some explicitly do not want a feed or community posts cluttering the app. As one user said, “I know many love the social aspect and so some [apps] have leaned into that heavily. But that’s meaningless to me… taking up most of the front page with social stuff is just an annoyance.”
 They praised TV Time for at least making the social elements optional (you can dip into comments if you want, but your main dashboard is your watch list/upcoming, not a social feed). This is a key design balance: users who prefer a pure utility app find the heavy social focus of some competitors to be noise. On the other hand, users who crave community find the more utilitarian apps to be bland or “dead.” So far, no app has perfectly reconciled these two user types. The closest might be Letterboxd, which by virtue of focusing on film buffs has a self-selected community that most of its users actually want to engage with. But even on Letterboxd, you can use it in a “solo” way (just log and ignore the social feed) – though the app’s design certainly nudges you toward participating.
In summary, community features generate both loyalty and complaints. Common asks include: better moderation tools (to block or filter content you don’t want to see), notifications for social interactions (something as simple as knowing you got a follower or a reply, which some apps oddly lack), and an ability to tailor the social experience (e.g. filter out joke reviews, or highlight content from friends over strangers). There’s also a divide between users about how prominent the social aspect should be. Any new entrant will need to tread carefully in this area – ideally allowing those who want a social network to have one, while letting those who don’t to simply use the app as a private tracker. Striking that balance could itself be a selling point given how polarizing current offerings are on this front.
Monetization and Pricing Woes
How these apps make money (or attempt to) is a sore subject in many user discussions. Passionate users often don’t mind paying something to support a good app – but they have strong opinions on what’s fair and what’s not. Key complaints here involve subscription price hikes, feature paywalls, and intrusive advertising:
Trakt VIP Pricing Backlash: The most dramatic example is Trakt’s recent pricing changes. In 2025, Trakt announced that all legacy VIP subscriptions (many long-time users were paying $15 or $30 per year from older plans) would be moved to a new standard price (~$60/year) upon renewal
. This effectively doubled (or even quadrupled) the cost for loyal users. The reaction was outrage. “Old users feel a little blindsided,” one Redditor explained
. Another wrote: “I was VIP for years and thought I was grandfathered in. Nope. They just double your subscription fee… I really felt blindsided.”
 What made it worse was some users found out via a PayPal auto-charge or email, rather than clear early communication
. Many considered this a betrayal of trust, since Trakt had previously promised grandfathered pricing. “We were told we were grandfathered. They really screwed us,” said a 10-year subscriber who had been paying $15 and will now be expected to pay $60
. While Trakt’s team gave reasons (rising costs, need to fund development)
, the damage was done in perception. Users compared the new price to the cost of actual content services: “The price…for a TV tracking app is more than I paid for a year of Crunchyroll and Paramount+, apps that deliver actual content,” one user noted incredulously
. The consensus among many: $5/month (or $60/year) is too expensive for a tracking utility, no matter the features. This led some to actively seek alternatives, or at least drop VIP and continue with Trakt’s free tier. As one long-time supporter said, “I was just supporting them because it is a cool service. But not $60-annually cool.”
.
Free Tier Limitations: Hand-in-hand with the above, Trakt also introduced new limitations on free accounts around the same time – notably capping the number of personal lists (to 10 lists, 100 items each) for free users
. This was seen as a double whammy: features that used to be open (unlimited lists) were now VIP-only, pushing more pressure to pay, right as the price increased. Users who never paid now had part of their workflow restricted. “The main thing that gets me is the list limitations,” one user wrote. “Adding new interesting [things] to watch is now a pain… man it hurts.”
. This kind of “enshittification” (as some call it
) – where a once-open platform slowly gatekeeps features behind a paywall – tends to generate a lot of resentment. It wasn’t just Trakt: JustWatch also introduced a Pro subscription with some extra features (like more refined filters, perhaps notifications for new episodes, etc.), sparking a smaller version of this discussion in r/JustWatch. Some veteran users see any move towards monetization of formerly free features as a betrayal, even if it might be necessary for the app’s survival. The key is that users value honesty and proportionality – dramatic changes (like Trakt’s) are met with “either mismanaged or greedy” accusations
. A lesson here is that any monetization changes need to be handled with extreme transparency and ideally grandfathering to avoid alienating the core user base.
Advertising and User Experience: On the flip side of subscriptions, advertising is the common revenue model for free users. But if done poorly, it drives users away just as fast. A glaring example was seen with Letterboxd’s Android app in late 2025 – users reported a wave of aggressive, glitchy ads. “Ads are auto-opening without clicking… I keep getting pulled onto websites, which makes the app feel like malware,” one review said bluntly
. They described ads causing the app to load improperly and basically ruining the experience, pleading for Letterboxd to fix this “dark time.”
 Another user, who initially gave Letterboxd 5 stars, downgraded their review after the UI changes and bugs, noting the app had become “buggy as hell” and implying the issues came alongside whatever monetization or redesign shift happened
. Intrusive ads – ones that hijack the interface, pop up frequently, or redirect to browser – can be fatal to an app’s reputation. Users will either pay to remove them (if they love the app enough) or uninstall in disgust. We also saw complaints about other apps: the Moviebase app (a Trakt client) was said to present “frequent, incredibly intrusive ads” unless you buy the premium version
. CineTrak/Cinexplore was more lenient (one-time purchase to remove ads, and it’s inexpensive)
, but the presence of ads at all in a tracking context can annoy users given they often open these apps many times a day. Interestingly, TV Time has no ads – something users do appreciate. “I wonder how the app makes money since there’s no ads?” one user mused, acknowledging that TV Time’s free experience is refreshingly ad-free
. (The answer: TV Time’s parent company likely monetizes by selling aggregate viewership data and trends to studios/networks via their analytics business, so they don’t need in-app ads. But to the user, it feels like a completely free app.)
“Value for Money” Concerns: Many premium features offered by these apps are nice-to-haves, not essentials, which influences how users perceive their value. For example, Trakt VIP includes things like year-in-review stats, advanced filtering, VIP profile badge, etc.
 – features one Redditor dismissed as “who even needs this stuff?” and “things that make zero sense, that are just invented to have a bullet point”
. That user (and others) felt Trakt should focus on core features people actually want, rather than padding VIP with gimmicks like badges or even personal stats, if those additions then serve as justification for a high price
. Similarly, Letterboxd’s paid tier offers yearly stats, the option to filter by streaming services, and profile personalization. Some find that worth $19/year, others don’t. The takeaway is that users scrutinize the feature-to-price ratio closely. If they perceive that a service is charging “Netflix money” for far less value, they will complain. On the other hand, they will pay for tangible benefits: e.g., some Trakt users only went VIP to support server costs and to get features like no ads and unlimited lists – when those were reasonably priced, it was seen as supporting a beloved service. The recent changes shook that goodwill.
Overall, monetization frustrations boil down to users feeling either priced out or annoyed by ads. Frequent themes include: “I would pay, but the price is too high for what it is”
, “They suddenly started charging for X that used to be free”, and “These ads are making the app unusable”. There’s also a sense of competition: because there are multiple apps in this space, if one goes rogue on monetization, users threaten to migrate to another (or at least voice that threat on Reddit). That keeps some pressure on these services not to stray too far from the expectations of their user community.
Having detailed the common pain points across UI, features, community, and monetization, it’s evident that each platform has its weaknesses. This leads us to look at the bigger picture: what gaps exist in the market due to these weaknesses, and how could a new app address them?
Competitive Weaknesses and Market Gaps
Despite the variety of tracking apps available, many users feel that none of them fully satisfy their needs. As one Redditor put it after extensive experimentation: “I’ve tried at least 3 dozen TV/Movie tracking apps. There isn’t a single one that doesn’t have at least 1 or 2 huge dealbreaker problems.”
 This is a striking statement – it suggests a significant market gap waiting to be filled by an app that can eliminate those dealbreakers. Let’s summarize the key weaknesses of current competitors and the gaps those create:
TV Time: Strengths include an easy-to-use interface for marking episodes, a large catalog (leveraging TVDB), and a big user community for popular shows. Its weaknesses are severe though: ongoing bugs and performance issues, lack of meaningful updates (some users feel the devs “don’t care about the app at all” anymore
), and no openness (no public API or easy data export without jumping through hoops). TV Time also leans more toward TV content, having only in recent years started to also track movies. For movie enthusiasts, TV Time’s features (and community) are relatively sparse compared to Letterboxd. Market gap: A stable, well-maintained app with a similar breadth of features and ease of use could steal TV Time’s thunder. Many are essentially waiting for something better to come along – indeed, posts like “Has anyone switched from TV Time to another app?”
 are common, indicating a readiness to jump ship if a viable alternative exists. Right now, people patch together solutions (e.g., using TV Time + Trakt in parallel
) to mitigate TV Time’s flaws.
Trakt: Trakt’s core strength is its comprehensive tracking engine and ecosystem – it’s the de facto backend for numerous apps (Showly, CineTrak, Media center plugins, etc.), and it covers both movies and TV. It also syncs with many third-party tools. Its weaknesses center on user-facing experience: the official app’s design decisions (removing some conveniences) have been contentious
, the community features are minimal, and recent monetization moves angered its most loyal users
. Additionally, depending on TMDB data has introduced those chronology issues and occasional content lags (e.g., TMDB’s movie database is great, but if a TV entry isn’t updated promptly, Trakt waits on it). Trakt is powerful, but some view it as too hardcore or not user-friendly enough for casual users – one review called the interface “overly complex and busy”, not well suited for a casual movie fan just wanting to log stuff
. Market gap: There’s room for a service as powerful as Trakt but more approachable and without the recent PR baggage. Also, since Trakt is now more expensive, a competitor that offers similar utility at a lower price (or with a different model) could attract cost-conscious users. Trakt’s recent turmoil actually spawned threads titled “What are our alternatives?” where long-time users share other options
 – evidence that a portion of Trakt’s user base might jump if they find a service that feels more respectful or user-centric.
Letterboxd: Letterboxd is the clear leader for film tracking/reviews, with a strong brand and community. Its limitation is content scope (no episodic TV support, at least not yet) – which means any serious TV watcher can’t rely on Letterboxd alone. There’s also a segment of users who simply don’t gel with the social vibe or UI, as seen by comments from a few who “can’t get into Letterboxd at all” and prefer IMDb’s utilitarian approach
. But overall, Letterboxd’s weaknesses are fewer in the tracking space; it’s more that it doesn’t directly compete on TV tracking. Market gap: The obvious one is a “Letterboxd for TV”, which some new apps (Serializd, Reelgood’s tracked content feature, etc.) are trying to be. If Letterboxd itself integrates TV, it could dominate that combined space, but until then, there’s an opportunity for another app to be the go-to for series the way Letterboxd is for films. Also, if an app could combine both movies and TV into one experience (with a slick social component), it might draw users who are currently splitting their time between Letterboxd and a TV-centric tracker.
JustWatch/Reelgood: These are great for what they do (aggregating streaming availability and letting you manage a universal watchlist across services). Their weakness is that they are not optimized for tracking your watching progress or recording your thoughts. They’re missing many of the “tracker” features like marking individual episodes, scoring/reviewing what you watched, getting insights on your viewing habits, etc.
. They also tend to be more utilitarian (not much of a social community built around them). Market gap: There is a convergence opportunity between discovery tools and tracking tools. As one user imagined, combining JustWatch’s streaming guide with TV Time’s tracking UI would create a powerhouse app
. Right now, users often use JustWatch alongside one of the above tracking apps. A new entrant that could eliminate the need to bounce between a “where to watch” app and a “what I watched” app would save users time and effort. Notably, the founder of Trakt even mentioned working on better JustWatch integration before – showing recognition that linking those functions is valuable
. But currently, the gap remains: if you want both great tracking and great discovery in one, you won’t find it.
Other Competitors (Serializd, Simkl, Hobi, etc.): Each smaller competitor has its niche but also weaknesses. For example, Simkl markets itself as a comprehensive tracker, but some users found its interface clunky and, like Trakt, it suffered the same “specials in a separate bin” problem (at least at one point)
. Hobi is a stylish mobile app for TV, but it’s limited to TV and is mobile-only (no web platform), and some users report it’s more for casual use (less feature-rich than TV Time). SeriesGuide (Android only) is lightweight and reliable, but purely utilitarian with no cloud sync unless paired with Trakt, and no social or discovery features. Next Episode is a web/mobile tracker that some rave is “stable and functional as hell”
, but it’s quite old-school in design and focuses only on TV shows, with manual checks for new episodes (no personalized recommendations, etc.). Moviebase, Cinexplore, Watchworthy, Queue, and others each try to improve on aspects of the experience (some focus on recommendations, some on stats, some on UI), but often they piggyback on Trakt or TMDB data and therefore inherit certain limitations. A telling comment from a Reddit user about Cinexplore: “like TV Time, it’s 85% exactly what I want, and 15% aggravating – just different exact wants and aggravations.”
 In other words, even the best alternative he found was still 15% frustrating. Multiply that by dozens of apps, and it’s clear why people feel the “perfect app” doesn’t exist.
To illustrate the state of the market, one user summarized their ideal “perfect app” by cherry-picking features from several services: “TV Time, exactly as it is, with its overall UI/UX and handling of episode order … PLUS JustWatch’s streaming options UI … PLUS Cinexplore’s handling of personal notes and cast/crew info … PLUS [another app’s] handling of watch dates … PLUS [an option to] ignore articles in titles for sorting … PLUS dates (not just countdowns) for upcoming releases.”
 They concluded: “Honestly, if TV Time added JustWatch’s streaming options interface and fixed the alphabetization, I’d never look at another show-tracking app again.”
 This wishlist reveals the gaps: no app currently combines an excellent UI, complete tracking features (with notes, custom sorting), full streaming info integration, and polished UX details like proper sorting and flexible date displays. Another broad gap in the market is user trust and goodwill. Some incumbents have squandered this (e.g., Trakt with its pricing drama). There’s an opening for a new app to present itself as user-friendly, transparent, and responsive to feedback. As one user said in a discussion about the lack of a perfect app: “The perfect TV tracking app just doesn’t exist... which is surprising considering the amount of cord-cutters today.”
 People see that with so many folks watching so much content across streaming services, a killer tracking app should be out there. The fact that many are still unhappy with what’s available suggests the first app to truly address these lingering pain points could capture a hungry audience. In short, the competitive weaknesses of current apps – whether it’s TV Time’s bugginess, Trakt’s monetization, Letterboxd’s no-TV limitation, or JustWatch’s lack of tracking features – create an environment where users are actively looking for a better solution. The market gaps identified include: a unified movies+TV platform, an app that prioritizes stability and user control, one that blends tracking with discovery, and one that adopts a fair monetization model. These represent opportunities for differentiation.
Opportunities for Differentiation in a New Tracking App
Given the laundry list of pain points above, a new entrant in this space has a clear roadmap of what not to do. By directly addressing user frustrations, a new app could differentiate itself and attract users eager for a better experience. Here are some key opportunities, distilled from the complaints we’ve seen: 1. Rock-Solid Stability and Support: Simply being reliable could be a killer feature. Users are tired of apps that crash, freeze, or glitch during basic tasks. A new app that invests in thorough testing (perhaps a lengthy beta with user feedback) and delivers a fast, smooth experience will stand out. As one user pithily said of TV Time, it’s “a great app… when it works!”
. The bar has been set low in this regard – many are so frustrated they’d flock to an app that just works consistently on both iOS and Android. Swift, responsive support is part of this too: being known as the app that quickly fixes data errors or bugs (where TV Time and others have been non-responsive
) would build trust. Essentially, make reliability a core feature – it may not be flashy, but it’s desperately needed. 2. Unified Movie and TV Tracking: There’s a golden opportunity to combine what Letterboxd and TV Time do into one unified platform. Users don’t want to maintain separate logs for films and series. A new app that treats movies, ongoing TV shows, limited series, and even other formats (documentaries, web shorts, etc.) under one roof would immediately attract those bouncing between apps. Letterboxd’s absence of TV support is a huge gap ready to be filled
. If the new app could import someone’s Letterboxd film diary and also import their TV Time/Trakt show list, that user could have everything in one place for the first time. Being the “one app to rule them all” (for all visual media tracking) is a strong differentiator. It’s challenging – it means dealing with multiple data sources and potentially complex UI (movies don’t have episodes; shows do) – but the demand is clearly there. 3. Superior Data Handling and Customization: The new app can win over detail-oriented users by solving the metadata issues others have struggled with. This means using a reliable database (or combining sources like TMDB and TVDB) to ensure complete and accurate listings of episodes (including specials, OVAs, bonus content) in the correct order. Offering users some control here could be a game-changer. For example, allow an option to treat “special” episodes as part of the main watchlist (for those who want to see everything chronologically)
, or conversely, an option to hide or separate them for those who don’t care. That flexibility would address the Doctor Who scenario that drove some away from Trakt
. Additionally, including data that others omit, like full cast and crew info at the episode level, is an opportunity. TV Time notably lacks crew credits (director/writer info)
, which film buffs and TV nerds do care about. A new app that lets you tap an episode and see not just a summary but who directed it, who guest-starred (and maybe even integrates with a site like IMDb or Wikipedia for one-click deeper info) would delight those users who currently juggle multiple apps to get that detail. Another customization: personal notes and tags for any entry. Many users want a field to jot down “why this is on my list” or “who recommended it”
 – implementing that (with privacy by default, unlike Letterboxd where lists/reviews are public) could draw in the planners and note-takers. And of course, fix the little things: allow sorting ignoring “A/An/The”
, allow marking a show as “abandoned” or an episode as “skipped”, allow logging re-watches properly (perhaps prompting for dates or tracking how many times watched). Each of these exists in one app or another, but no app has all of them. Being the first to cover all these bases would check a lot of user wishlist boxes. 4. Easy Migration (Import/Export): This is a huge opportunity to win goodwill. Users are practically begging for an easier way to move their data
. A new app that offers one-click import from the major services (TV Time, Trakt, Letterboxd, IMDb watchlist, maybe even CSV files) will lower the barrier for curious users to try it out. Simkl has the right idea here by building import tools
; a new app should do the same, perhaps even improving on it with an in-app wizard: “Connect your accounts and import your watched history.” If privacy or API limitations make direct import tricky, even providing a well-documented method or assistance (and export in a standard format like CSV or JSON for transparency) would signal that this app doesn’t believe in trapping users’ data. Considering how many people said they stayed with a subpar app only because migrating was too exhausting
, removing that obstacle can rapidly build a user base. Users will feel safer investing time into a new platform if they know they can leave with their data intact if needed. In a landscape where others seem to use lock-in as a retention tactic, a new app’s philosophy of data portability would sharply differentiate it. 5. Integrated Discovery and Streaming Info: Bridging the gap between tracking and discovery could be a signature feature. A new app can take inspiration from JustWatch/Reelgood by integrating a streaming availability guide. For example, when you view a movie or show entry, the app could show where it’s currently streaming (with filters for region, free/subscription). Even better, allow users to set their streaming service subscriptions in their profile and then filter availability accordingly – e.g., “show me where I can watch this with my existing subscriptions.” This addresses a user complaint that some apps show services they don’t care about (paid VOD they’ll never use) without ability to filter
. If this app can incorporate a robust database of where titles are available (either via licensing JustWatch’s API or another source), it saves users from hopping out to another app or Google. Moreover, add features like notifying users when something on their watchlist hits a streaming service. JustWatch Pro does this, I believe, but a lot of people would love to have it combined with their tracker. On the recommendation side, the app should leverage its data to suggest what to watch next. Many users loved TV Time’s recommendations
; a new app should definitely have a recommendation engine (perhaps even an AI-driven or collaborative filtering one to stand out). Given the data it collects on user tastes, it could cross-recommend TV shows based on movies liked and vice versa – something few do because apps are siloed to one domain. There’s also an opportunity for discovery modes: maybe a curated “Popular this week on your services” or editorial lists (Letterboxd does community lists very well; a new app could encourage user-made lists or integrate RottenTomatoes/IMDB top lists for exploration). Essentially, becoming a one-stop app for “What should I watch and what have I watched” is the endgame. Users have explicitly wished for the fusion of tracking and discovery interfaces
 – the first app to nail that will have an edge. 6. Balanced Social Features (Opt-in Community): As discussed, users are split on social elements. The opportunity here is to design a social experience that is customizable and non-intrusive. A new app could allow users to toggle the visibility of a social feed on their home screen. For those who want community, provide features like episode discussion threads (a la TV Time), movie reviews and ratings (a la Letterboxd), the ability to follow friends and see a feed of what they watch or review. But importantly, also provide filters and controls: e.g., a setting to only show reviews from people you follow (reducing noise from random joke reviews), or a content filter to hide spoilers and toxic language (maybe via community moderation or automated detection). The app could even innovate by having thematic discussion groups or integrating with existing communities (like pulling in Reddit discussions for an episode – though that’s tricky to do well). Meanwhile, for users who couldn’t care less about social, the app should let them default to a purely personal dashboard (just their shows/movies, upcoming releases, etc.). This way, the app caters to both demographics – something current apps don’t fully do. Notifying users of direct interactions is easy low-hanging fruit (if someone comments on your review or follows you, you should get a notification – TV Time dropping the ball here is an example to improve upon
). By having an opt-in social model, the app can advertise community features without alienating those who prefer solo use. This could be a strong differentiator: all the social functionality if you want it, but none of the pressure or feed clutter if you don’t. Considering one user’s praise that “TV Time lets you go [to the social features] if you want to”
, that principle can be a design guideline. 7. Fair and Transparent Monetization: Finally, a new app has a huge opportunity to earn goodwill by doing monetization in a user-friendly way. This means avoiding sudden massive price hikes or paywalling basic features that have been free historically. Options could include: a reasonable subscription (say, $1–3 per month or $10–20 per year) that offers genuinely useful perks but doesn’t hamstring free users; or a one-time purchase model for certain features (like Cinexplore’s inexpensive premium unlock
). The key is to communicate clearly why supporting the app is worthwhile. For instance, if the app has no ads for anyone (the ideal scenario), explain that a premium sub supports the costs and maybe offers cosmetic bonuses and advanced stats in return. If it uses ads on free accounts, ensure they are non-intrusive (no full-screen takeovers, no auto-redirecting to browser as Letterboxd’s did
). Perhaps limit ads to certain sections or allow an in-app banner rather than disruptive interstitials. Also, explicitly promise data portability and no lock-in even for free users – this builds trust that you’re not holding their data hostage for ransom. By treating users with respect, a new app can differentiate itself from competitors that are seen as money-grabbing or increasingly greedy
. A smart move could be offering a loyalty or founding member discount to early adopters (avoiding Trakt’s mistake of revoking grandfathered pricing and angering veterans
). Show that you value long-term supporters. In essence, make users feel like stakeholders, not sources of cash to be squeezed. This intangible goodwill can be a big competitive advantage – people will evangelize an app that they feel does right by them, especially in contrast to others that have let them down (e.g., many former Trakt VIPs publicly vented and canceled – a new app could capture that sentiment by offering a refuge with fair pricing). In conclusion, a new tracking app can stand out by being the anti-hero to all these common complaints. Focus on stability, encompass all content, be obsessively user-focused in features, embrace interoperability (imports) rather than walled gardens, blend tracking with discovery, and adopt a fair monetization strategy. The user community has essentially drawn a roadmap through their complaints. As one user observed, “the perfect app just doesn’t exist… which is surprising”
 – but it could exist if an app listens to what people have been asking for. By learning from the missteps of TV Time, Trakt, JustWatch, Letterboxd, and others, a new entrant could carve out a devoted following and fill this gap in the market. The appetite for a better solution is clearly there, as evidenced by the countless forum threads of frustrated users. Whichever app manages to address these pain points will likely find an enthusiastic audience ready to champion it. Sources:
